                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
                        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
                        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
                        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
                        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
                        going through the cites of the word in classical 
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
                        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus 
                        Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by 
                        Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
                        theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
                        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit 
                        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
